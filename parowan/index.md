As the first settlement of southern Utah (settled January 13, 1851), Parowan is affectionately called the "Mother Town of Southern Utah".  Many of the original homes and business buildings still line the downtown area of the community, along with a tree-lined Main Street that take visitors on a nostalgic trip back through time.

Pioneer museums, a historic cemetery and numerous historic sites are open for visitors to see.

Parowan also is the gateway from Interstate 15 to some of the most spectacular scenic attractions, state and national parks, Utah’s Patchwork Parkway Historic Byway 143, and varied natural geological formations.

The Town of Parowan invites you to tour through our website and enjoy our hometown hospitality.  Here, you’ll find information on community services and events, scenic attractions, history, businesses and recreational activities our area has to offer.
