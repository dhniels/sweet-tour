A stop in Parowan for a delicious cinnamon treat evokes memories of a simpler time. As the first settlement in southern Utah, Parowan is affectionately called the “Mother Town”. Many of the original homes and buildings still line the streets of the community, giving visitors a nostalgic trip back to pioneer times. Heritage museums, a pioneer cemetery, and numerous historic sites are open for visitors to see. Parowan is the gateway to some of the area’s spectacular scenic attractions, state and national parks, and Utah’s Patchwork Scenic Byway 143.
